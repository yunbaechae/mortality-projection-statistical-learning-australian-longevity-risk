# Mortality Projection and Statistical Learning for Australian Longevity Risk Modelling

ACST3059 Actuarial Modelling Assignment 1 (2023)

This assignment projected Australian mortality trends using statistical learning methods for longevity risk modelling. Focused on quantitative projection, curve fitting, and actuarial implications.

## Key Tasks
- Applied statistical models to project mortality decline  
- Generated mortality curves and longevity risk estimates  
- Analysed quantitative implications for actuarial models  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Mortality projection and statistical learning  
- Longevity risk modelling and quantitative analysis  
- R programming for projection and validation  

## Submission Details
- Original R Markdown source (ChaeYunbaeRcode_7897842_952795834.Rmd) included for reproducibility  
- Rendered PDF (ChaeYunbaeReport_7897842_1729174973.pdf) shows full projection models, curves, and quantitative results
